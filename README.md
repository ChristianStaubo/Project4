# Gamehub



## What is gamehub

Gamehub was my final project at General Assembly. It is a 3D website that hosts plenty of games both single and multiplayer. I used a MERN stack, with react three fiber for the 3D rendering, and socket io for the multiplayer games. 


## Is this really it?

If you're reading this, I am still working on improving the app.


## Installation instructions
clone down the repo and npm i.
